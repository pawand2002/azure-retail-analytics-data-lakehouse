# 🗂️ Dataset Overview
- Generator Script: generate_sales_data.py
- Format: CSV + optional Parquet
- Fields: TransactionID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, Price, TransactionDate, Region
- Scope: ~6 months of synthetic retail activity across regions and products

# 🎯 Core Objectives
- Build reusable ETL flows using ADF pipelines
- Ingest and transform zone-based data in ADLS Gen2
- Apply Kimball-style dimensional modeling via Synapse Serverless SQL
- Create dynamic Power BI dashboards for sales insights
- Explore parameterized views, SCD types, and semantic layers

# 📈 Business Use Case
Objective: Analyze retail sales data to uncover trends, high-performing regions/products, and forecast revenue.

Data Source: Retail transactions CSV file (uploaded manually or automated).

Users: Business analysts, operations teams, and sales managers.

# Layers Explained:

* **Bronze Layer (Raw Data Lake):** Stores raw, immutable sales data as ingested from the source (CSV). This layer acts as a landing zone.
* **Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed Data Lake):** Data from the Bronze layer is cleaned, validated, and transformed into a structured, conformed format (Parquet). This layer is ready for further aggregation and feature engineering.
* **Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data Lake):** Aggregated and highly optimized data (Parquet) for direct consumption by business intelligence tools and analytical applications. This layer contains key business metrics like daily total sales, unique customers, and transaction counts.

## Azure Services Used

* **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2):** Scalable and secure data lake for storing data in various formats across all layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
* **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Cloud-based ETL/ELT service used for orchestrating the data movement and performing complex data transformations via Mapping Data Flows.
* **Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL Pool):** Provides a SQL interface over the data in ADLS Gen2, enabling ad-hoc querying and creating logical views (Gold Layer) without provisioning dedicated resources.
* **Power BI:** Business intelligence tool for creating interactive dashboards and reports, consuming data directly from the Synapse Serverless SQL Pool view (DirectQuery).
